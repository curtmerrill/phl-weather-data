# Random weather data

Back in 2015, I set up a script to log weather data every 30 minutes. I just
discovered that it was still running.

I probably had an idea for something to do with all of this data, but I
donâ€™t remember what it was.

So here's a year and half of weather data for Philadelphia.

Enjoy.
